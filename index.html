        <p>This is your website, you're using code to render this words into browser. Doesn't it sound cool?</p>
        <p>But you don't want  website, you want an application. But you would need to learn how to code first. You will learn that by making  your own site. You said it's 2020 already, remember?
        <p>Turns out a so-called Static website is what i need right now. Static means it just renders what it is for everybody. If there's user data or somethign that should be fetched from the server then it's dynamic. Correct me with your PR (pool request)</p>
